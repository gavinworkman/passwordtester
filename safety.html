        <h1>Web Safety Tips</h1>
        

        <h2>Recognizing Secure Websites</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Look for HTTPS:</b> In the URL bar, if the website you are on doesn't have a lock symbol and start with HTTP<u>S</u>, then proceed with caution. This means that the data passed between you and the site isn't secure and encrypted. Avoid entering sensitive information on these sites.</li>
                <li><b>Avoid "Not Secure" Warnings:</b> Many browsers have built-in safety features. Sometimes your browser will recognize a sketchy website and alert you that it is not secure. While I would recommend  not proceeding to the site, If you must access the site, avoid entering personal information.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Avoid Suspicious Downloads</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Download from Trusted Sources Only:</b> When installing applications, only download from official stores. Third-Party sites may offer better deals, but have a much higher likelihood of compromising your information. At the very least, do a background check on all third-party download sources online to see if they are legit.</li>
                <li><b>Watch for Warning Signs:</b> When on websites trying to download something, watch out for pop-ups saying things like "<em>Free Download</em>" or "<em>Download Now</em>" as they are commonly ads that redirect you to a very sketchy website asking you to download software that most certainly has some form of malware inside it.</li>
                <li><b>Use Antivirus Software:</b> Antivirus software is constantly updated to protect you from various threats and scans new downloads to find malware before it harms you.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Understanding Common Online Scams</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Phishing Emails and Messages:</b> Phishing attempts often look very legitimate, using logos or familiar phrases from trusted brands or services that apply to you. However, many have something slightly off, like an unofficial looking link, misspelled words, or bad grammar. If you recognize a phishing email, block the sender and do not click on any link.</li>
            <li><b>Verify Requests for Sensitive Information:</b> Many banks and legitimate organizations tell you on their official page that they will never ask for sensitive information in an email or text message. Make sure before you email someone your username and password that you confirm it is official (most the time it is not).</li>
            <li><b>If it's too good to be true, it is:</b> If you see an advertisement for an extremely low priced product or service, some software guaranteeing to boost your computer's processing speed, or a model saying they want to chat, don't click them. Sometimes just travelling to a website is enough for harm to be done to your computer. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Managing Browser Privacy Settings</h2>
       <ul>
        <li><b>Enable "Do Not Track":</b> Browsers and websites track a lot of data about their users, which is how they make their money (by selling your browsing data). Enabling all "Do not Track" settings can help limit the amount of information being collected and make you more secure online.</li>
        <li><b>Use Private Browsing Mode:</b> Many browsers have a private or incognito mode, and enabling this means that none of your data is saved after you go out of the mode.</li>
        <li><b>Regularly clear cookies and cache:</b> Cookies is all the data that a browser saves to give to websites. This is how my site knows if you have viewed it before or not, saying either "Welcome Back" or "Welcome to my site for the first time" (these are the only cookies I use). It is also how you don't have to sign in to all your accounts every time you go to sites like YouTube or Amazon. However, if you visited a sketchy website, they may have imposed some malicious cookies or tracking data. Clearing your cookies and the cache regularly helps to remove old tracking data and those malicious cookies and can make your browser run faster as well.</li>
